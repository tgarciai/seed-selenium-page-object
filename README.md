Selenium Page Object Model

This seed is developed to show how to develop an scalable automatization for browser apps:

1.- Automation test closely coupled to UI(the wrong way)

2.- Automation test decoupled from UI via PageObject pattern (no frameworks)

3.- TAutomation test decoupled from UI via PageObject pattern (cucumber and others frameworks)


Test Execution:

launch the gradle task "test"


Note: 1 and 2 requires an uptate ChromeDriverConfig with the local path that the chrome driver its installed.
